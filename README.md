# The Project: Mesto <sup>Russia</sup>

## About the project
A small site with adaptive layout (320px to 1280px+) and semantic markup where students of the same group can post photos they like. Backend provided by Yandex. Registration is not possible (accounts were issued by the student group supervisor to each student). There is no photo moderation, so I apologize in advance if any of the students in the group posted indecent or offensive content. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

The user can change his name, information about himself and avatar, like the photo he likes, upload or delete his own photos. Clicking on a photo opens a popup with a photo preview.

I used JavaScript ES6 (classes), CSS Flexbox and GRID, followed the [BEM Nested](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/) methodology in naming CSS classes and grouping CSS files, and building the project using Webpack.
